# Annotated Multi-Line Plot

This project demonstrates how to build a publication-style multi-line plot using `matplotlib` with annotation arrows, marker controls, and custom axis formatting.

## 📈 Features
- Three distinct mathematical curves plotted together:
  - **Sinc Function** (`sinc(x) * 20`)
  - **Log Growth** (`log(x+1) * 10`)
  - **Cosine/x Decay** (`cos(x)/x * 30`)
- Custom markers placed periodically (`markevery`)
- Colored annotation arrows pointing to key data features
- Title, axis labels, legend, gridlines, and controlled limits
- Clean background and layout formatting

## 🎯 Learning Objectives
- Plot multiple functions on a single figure
- Add annotations and arrows for emphasis
- Control tick frequency and style markers
- Format line types and curve shapes for clean presentation

## 🚀 How to Run
```bash
python annotated_plot.py
```

## 🧰 Requirements
- Python 3.x
- matplotlib
- numpy

## 💡 Future Ideas
- Add interactive data cursor
- Enable export to PDF/image with tight margins
- Animate curves over time
